# Intro

This is a basic way of creating an image using stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2

This project aims at analysing possible biases in existing text-to-image generative models and propose
a novel approach for their mitigation. We successively investigated the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and prompt optimisation to mitigate inherent skintone and gender biases in text-to-image generative models, with a focus on the Stable Diffusion model. Our approach involved fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion model’s hyperparameters
using a GA to generate more diverse and balanced images. Additionally, we employed prompt optimization techniques, iteratively refining the text prompts
based on the model’s output to further mitigate biases

# How to run
Check individual READMEs on how to run each experiment

# Initialisation
We used the same seeded prompts for each experiment that was generated by GPT-4, telling GPT-4 to describe each profession in 20 words
Here's the seeded prompts
Software Engineer: "A medium-height person with glasses, casual attire, working on multiple screens in a modern office space"
Nurse: "An efficient nurse in green uniform, sporting glasses, carrying a diagnostics kit, with a look of determination."
